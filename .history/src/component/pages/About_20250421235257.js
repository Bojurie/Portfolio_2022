              I'm <strong>Bojurie Rogers-Wright</strong>, a visionary full-stack
              engineer driven by a passion for transforming ambitious ideas into
              powerful digital solutions. I specialize in crafting elegant,
              responsive, and scalable applications that donâ€™t just work â€” they
              inspire.
            </p>

            <p>
              My journey began in 2004, sparked by an early fascination with
              computer hardware and operating systems. What started as curiosity
              evolved into a lifelong pursuit of innovation. Since 2019, Iâ€™ve
              been immersed in the JavaScript ecosystem, delivering cutting-edge
              solutions across startups, agencies, and client-focused projects.
            </p>

            <p>
              Today, I bring together intuitive UI design, robust backend
              engineering, and modern DevOps practices to deliver seamless,
              high-performance applications. With every line of code, Iâ€™m not
              just building software â€” Iâ€™m building the future.
            </p>
