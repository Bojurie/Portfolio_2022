            <p>
              I'm <strong>Bojurie Rogers-Wright</strong>, a passionate
              full-stack developer focused on building elegant, responsive, and
              scalable web and mobile applications. I thrive on transforming
              ideas into impactful digital experiences â€” blending creativity

            </p>

            <p>
              My journey into tech began in 2004, sparked by a curiosity for
              hardware and systems. Over the years, I've grown through
              self-learning, professional experience, and a deep love for
              solving problems through software. Since 2019, I've been immersed
              in JavaScript ecosystems, collaborating on a variety of projects
              across startups, agencies, and client-based work.
            </p>

            <p>
              Today, I specialize in developing full-stack solutions with
              intuitive UI, efficient backend logic, and modern DevOps
              practices. Iâ€™m constantly learning and pushing boundaries to build
              accessible, high-performing applications.
